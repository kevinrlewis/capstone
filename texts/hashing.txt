A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size 
to a bit string of a fixed size which is designed to only work in one-way. The only way to 
recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function's output is to attempt a 
brute-force search of possible inputs to try and find a match. The input data is often 
called the message, and the output is often called the message digest. The same message 
always results in the same digest and the computation of the digest is usually fast. Some 
popular hash functions include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and BLAKE2.
