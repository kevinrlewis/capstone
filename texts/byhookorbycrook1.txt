Sometimes, codebreakers use more than mathematics and
logic to crack codes. The pre=war Polish codebreaking
attempts partly relied on the German traitor Hans-Thilo
Schmidt, who provided them with valuable information about
the Enigma cipher. Schmidt felt abandoned by his nation and
his family, so he sold cipher information via the French as a
way of getting back at those who had let him down.

Occasionally, Bletchley would make a breakthrough thanks to
a clever ploy involving the RAF. British planes would lay
mines in a particular location, provoking the Germans to send
out a warning to their vessels. This Enigma encrypted warning
would contain predictable words, so it could be used as a crib.

An alternative strategy for cracking Enigma depended on
stealing cipher information. Ian Fleming, creator of James
Bond and a member of wartime Naval Intelligence, suggested
crashing a captured German bomber in the English Charmel,
close to a German ship. German sailors would then approach
to rescue their comrades, whereupon the British pilots
pretending to be German aircrew would board the ship and
capture Enigma keys. Operation Ruthless was postponed due
to lack of German shipping in the Charmel and was eventually
cancelled.
