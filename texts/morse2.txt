In Europe, Morse's approach gradually overtook the Wheatstone-Cooke system in 
popularity, and in 1851 a European form of Morse Code, which included accented 
letters, was adopted throughout the Continent. As each year passed, Morse code and 
the telegraph had an increasing influence on the world, enabling the police to capture 
more criminals, helping newspapers to bring the very latest news, providing valuable 
information for businesses, and allowing distant companies to make instantaneous 
deals. Type your message into the box labeled 'Plaintext', then click the 'Encipher' 
button to convert the message into Morse Code.
