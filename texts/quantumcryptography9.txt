So when Alice sends polarised photons to Bob,
he will be able to establish with certainty the bit
value of a fraction of them. Alice could send a
series of a hundred photons, each one polarised
at random, while Bob randomly switched
between his filters. Typically, three-quarters of
them would be blocked, but Bob would know
the bit value for the lucky minority that got
through. Bob could then call Alice on the
telephone and tell her exactly which 25 photons
he received. These would form the key for
encrypting a subsequent message. The key could
be used as the basis for a one time pad.

Although Bob tells Alice which photons he
correctly measured, he does not say which filter
he used to measure them. So even if Eve
overhears the telephone conversation, she gains
no information about the composition of the
key.

And, crucially, if Eve tries to intervene at an
earlier stage by intercepting the photons on their
way to Bob, then her presence becomes
apparent.
