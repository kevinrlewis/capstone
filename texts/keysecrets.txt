Each distinct cipher can be split into two halves. The general encrypting method is known as the 
ALGORITHM. The exact details of the encryption algorithm are defined by a KEY. In the case of a 
monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the algorithm involves substituting each letter in the message 
with a letter from a cipher alphabet, and the key defines the exact cipher alphabet to be used. The 
key tells the algorithm how to manipulate the plaintext to turn it into ciphertext.
