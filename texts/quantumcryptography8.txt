Suppose Bob chooses his -45° filter to measure a
photon from Alice, and no photon passes
through. He cannot know whether Alice sent a
+45° photon (meaning 1), which is always
blocked, or if she sent a 0° photon (meaning 0),
which is only sometimes blocked. If a photon
does pass through his filter, then he is in luck:
he can be sure that Alice sent a 0° photon.

This means that Bob knows that if a photon
passes through his -45° filter, Alice must be
sending him a 0. Similarly, if he uses his 90°
filter and the photon passes through, then Alice
must have sent a +45° photon.
