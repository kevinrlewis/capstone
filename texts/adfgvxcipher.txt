In addition to the use of the codes, the First World War saw the development of some new ciphers. The German ADFGVX 
cipher features both substitution and transposition, so it has a 2-part key. Encryption begins with a 6x6 grid randomly 
filled with the 26 letters and the 10 diets. Each row and column of the grid is identified by one of the six letters A, 
D, F, G, V or X. The arrangement of the elements in the grid acts as the substitution part of the key, so the receiver 
needs to know the details of the grid in order to he able to decipher messages. The first stage of encryption involves 
taking each letter of the message, locating its position in the grid and substituting it with the letters that label 
its row and column. For example, in the grid provided, 'p' would be replaced by AD. Click the 'Stage 1' button to begin 
the encipherment of the short message below (or generate your own grid by clicking 'Randomise Grid Key' or create your 
own message before clicking 'Stage 1').
