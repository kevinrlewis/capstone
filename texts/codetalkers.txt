During the Pacific campaign, American commanders realised that cipher machines, such as SIGABA, had a 
fundamental drawback. Although electromechanical encryption offered relatively high levels of security, it was 
painfully slow and not ideally suited to hostile environments, such as the islands of the Pacific. However, Navajo, or 
any other Native American language, could act as a virtually unbreakable code. If each battalion in the Pacific 
employed a pair of Native Americans as radio operators, secure communication could be guaranteed.

In World War One Captain E.W. Horner had employed eight men from the Choctaw tribe as radio operators. 
Obviously none of the enemies understood their language, and so the Choctaw provided secure communications. 
However, this encryption system was fundamentally flawed, because the Choctaw language had no equivalents for 
modern military jargon. Hence, a message involving a specific technical term might have to be translated into a 
vague Choctaw expression which could be misinterpreted by the receiver. To avoid this problem in World War Two 
a lexicon of Navajo terms was constructed to replace otherwise untranslatable English words. Navajo trainees 
helped to compile the lexicon, choosing words describing the natural world to indicate specific military terms. Thus, 
the names of birds replaced types of planes, and fish replaced ships:
