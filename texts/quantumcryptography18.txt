Hughes estimates that transmitting a quantum
key 2 kilometres horizontally would be
equivalent to reaching a satellite in low-Earth
orbit.

He plans to try a 2-kilometre demonstration
later this year. Then, within two years, he hopes
to conduct a quantum cryptographic exchange
with an actual satellite.

If Hughes's experiments go to plan, global
satellite communications could be protected by
secure quantum cryptography within a decade.
In the meantime, optical fibres will allow
communications on a much smaller scale. Even
now, it would be possible to build a quantum
cryptographic optical fibre link between the
White House and the Pentagon. Perhaps there
already is one.
