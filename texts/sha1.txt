SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function created by the United States National 
Security Agency and was a standard until it was found vulnerable in 2005. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash 
value and can be used for SSL certificates as verification. Majority of organizations have stopped 
accepting SHA-1 SSL certificates and recommend using SHA-2 or SHA-3. SHA-1 is considered vulnerable due 
to collisions found with little computational effort.
