Secure Shell (SSH) is primarily used for remote access to computer systems by users. SSH 
provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, 
connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. It is an alternative to some other 
protocols such as telnet, rlogin, and FTP. The connection is first established by the SSH 
client connecting to the SSH server. The SSH client drives the connection setup process 
and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server. Once setup, the 
SSH protocol uses symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure privacy of the 
transferred information.
