The Vigenere cipher was 
believed to be unbreakable, 
hence its nickname 'the 
uncrackable cipher' or 'le 
chiffre undechiffrable'.

However, the Vigenere cipher 
was not a perfect cipher. It was 
cracked in the 19th century, 
notably by the eccentric British 
genius Charles Babbage.

This section explains who 
Babbage was, how he cracked 
the Vigenere cipher, and why he 
kept his breakthrough secret.

The section also includes a tool
