To determine d (the private key) in the previous example, we are trying to find
the multiplicative inverse of 7 (mod 160). In effect, we are solving the equation:

										7 x d = 1 (mod 160)

We start by applying Euclidâ€™s algorithm:

										160 = 22 x 7 + 6

										7 = 6 x 1 + 1

										Therefore: 1 = 7 - 6 x 1

										1 = 7 - (160 - 22 x 7) x 1

										1 = 7 x 23 - 160

In other words, we are trying to build the number 1 from 7s and 160s, and
the final equation tells us that 7 x 23 = 1 (mod 160), in other words d = 23.
