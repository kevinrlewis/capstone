For over two decades, the discovery of
public-key cryptography (PKC) was
attributed to Diffie, Hellman and Merkle,
alongside Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.
However, in 1997 it was announced that
PKC was first discovered in secret by
British government cryptographers at the
Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham.
