A complete circuit might represent the rotor position 
part of the key that was used to encrypt the message, 
and the remainder of the key can he deduced relatively 
easily. There may be several complete circuits, but the 
number of false consistencies can be greatly reduced 
by using longer cribs with more complex loops.
