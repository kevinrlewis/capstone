The public's growing fascination in cryptographic techniques 
meant that codes and ciphers soon found their way into 19th 
century literature. In Jules Verne's 'Voyage to the Centre of the 
Earth', the decipherment of a parchment filled with runic 
characters provides the first step on the epic journey. In Britain,
one of the finest writers of cryptographic fiction was Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle. Not surprisingly, Sherlock Holmes was an expert 
in cryptography and, as he explained to Dr. Watson, was "the 
author of a trifling monograph upon the subject in which I analyse 
one hundred and sixty separate ciphers." The most famous of 
Holmes's decipherments is told in 'The Adventure of the Dancing 
Men', which involves a cipher consisting of stickmen, each pose 
representing a distinct letter.
