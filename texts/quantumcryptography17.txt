Afterwards, Alice and Bob used an insecure
Ethernet link to check for errors in their key.
Because there was no Eve attempting to intercept
the key, there should have been no errors. In
fact, background photons, detector noise and
misaligmnent introduced an error rate of 1.6 per
cent, but this isn't too serious. If Eve had been
listening in, she would have caused an error rate
more like 25 per cent, so Alice and Bob can still
be confident that their key is secure.

So how close is practical free-space quantum
cryptography? At first sight there's a big
difference between the 500 metres Hughes sent
his quantum cryptographic key and the 300
kilometres needed to reach a communications
satellite. But Hughes is closer to his goal than
these figures suggest. His photons traveled
horizontally, at ground level, where the air is
dense and fluctuations are greatest.
