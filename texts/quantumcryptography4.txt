every possible key, she'd find that many of them
made some sort of sense, and wouldn't know
how to choose between the alternatives. Bob, on
the other hand, has a copy of the key, and can
decipher the message by simply subtracting the
key from the encrypted text.

The onetime pad cipher is so called because
each key used to be written on a separate sheet
of a pad of paper. After being used once, the
sheet was torn off and destroyed, leaving the
new key on the next sheet ready to encrypt the
next message. Despite being theoretically
perfect, the onetime pad cipher suffers from
several practical flaws, which have prevented its
widespread use. Making random keys is a
difficult task, and making a new one for each
message is time consuming. The real killer,
though, is distributing the keys. After Alice has
manufactured a random key, encrypted her
message, and sent the encrypted text, she
somehow has to get the key to Bob so that he
can decrypt the message. She cannot send the
key unencrypted because Eve will steal it, and
she cannot encrypt it because she then has to tell
Bob the key she used to encrypt the key that she
used to encrypt the message.
