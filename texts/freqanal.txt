Al-Kindi's technique for cracking a substitution cipher relied on the fact that letters have 
'personalities', and part of a letter's personality is its frequency - some letters are more common 
than others. In English, the frequency of each letter is shown in the table above - "e" is the most 
common letter, followed by "t", then "a", and so on.

So if we have a ciphertext that we are trying to 
crack, we start by working out the frequency of 
each letter. If the most common letter in the 
ciphertext is, for example, "J" then it would seem 
likely that this is a substitute for "e". And if the 
second most common letter in the ciphertext is 
"P", then this is probably a substitute for "t", 
and so on. Al-Kindi's technique, know as 
frequency analysis, shows that it is unnecessary 
to check each of the billions of potential keys. 
Instead, it is possible to reveal the contents of an 
encrypted message simply by analysing the 
frequency of the characters in the ciphertext. To
