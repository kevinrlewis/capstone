According to Suetonius, Caesar simply replaced each letter in a message with
 the letter that is three places further down the alphabet. Cryptographers often 
think in terms of the plain alphabet, the alphabet used to write the original 
message, and the cipher alphabet, the letters that are substituted in place of 
the plain letters.

When the plain alphabet is placed above the cipher alphabet, as shown below, 
it is clear to see that the cipher alphabet has been shifted by three places, 
and hence this form of substitution is often called the Caesar shift cipher. 
A cipher is the name given to any form of cryptographic substitution in which 
each letter is replaced by another letter or symbol.

Type your message into the Plaintext box. You can encrypt by clicking 
'Encipher Plaintext'. Please note, you can change the cipher by changing 
the shift, so the message can be encrypted in different ways.
