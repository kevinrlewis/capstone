The key-distribution problem was traditionally
solved by employing trusted couriers to deliver
the keys by hand, but this solution doesn't have
much appeal in the age of satellite
communications and email.

In the 1970s, cryptographers invented public key
cryptography as a solution, because this avoided
the necessity for highly secure key distribution.
But the security of public key cryptography
could be undermined if mathematicians
developed some new techniques that attacked
the core of public key systems.

It is here that quantum physics comes to the
rescue. In the early 1980s, Charles Bennett, an
IBM researcher, and Gilles Brassard, a
computer scientist at the University of Montreal,
proposed that Alice and Bob should use
individual photons to exchange their key. By
operating at the quantum level, they argued,
Alice and Bob could exploit the laws of
quantum physics to protect the key.

Bennett and Brassard proposed using photons
polarised in different directions to represent
1 or 0. If Eve tried to intercept the key, she
would have to measure the photons, which
would effectively mean absorbing them.
