- Police forces fight crime by tapping phones and intercepting communication between
criminals, but this is becoming ineffective because of encryption. The FBI maintains
that “court ordered wiretapping is the single most effective investigative technique
used by law enforcement to combat illegal drugs, terrorism, violent crime, espionage
and organised crime.”

- International crime and terrorism will also grow with the help of encryption.
Terrorist groups already use encryption to evade surveillance and hide evidence.

- The right to use strong encryption could be maintained and law enforcement could
still be effective if users were willing to hand over their secret keys to a third party.
That third party, perhaps the judiciary, would then hand keys to the police if a
person was suspected of a crime.

- Ultra-strong encryption is unnecessary. Moderate encryption is sufficient for most
purposes (e.g., privacy, credit card exchange), so this is the only level that should be
tolerated. If there is a justification for deciphering somebody’s communications,
then the police could use supercomputers to crack moderate encryption, but they
would not be able to do this routinely, so we would not be in danger of encouraging
a Big Brother society.
