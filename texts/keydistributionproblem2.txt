This is not a trivial problem, because the key has to be distributed via a secure
route, otherwise it will fall into the hands of the enemy. In general, there is no such route for
getting the key to the receiver. If there were a secure route, then the message would be sent this
way and would not need to be encrypted. For example, you cannot telephone the receiver and
read out the key, because the enemy might be tapping your phone. And you cannot encrypt the
key and send it, because this assumes that you have already sent a previous key to the receiver.
Getting the key between the sender and the receiver is known as the key distribution problem.
