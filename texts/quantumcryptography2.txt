What everyone is looking for is a new form of
code, one that is truly unbreakable. That's
where the quantum world comes in. Exploiting
the strange uncertainties of quantum physics
can give you a code that nobody-no matter how
clever-will ever be able to crack.

That's the theory. The trouble comes when you
try putting it into practice. When quantum
particles interact with the large-scale world they
tend to lose the delicate information they
contain. This makes it fiendishly difficult to use
them to send information over any sensible
distance. Difficult, but not impossible. In the
past few years, researchers have succeeded in
sending quantum-encrypted messages tens of
kilometres down optical fibres. Now the
challenge is to find a way to send
quantum-encrypted information through the air.
This will open the way to fully secure global
communications, beamed up to an orbiting
satellite and forwarded to any place on Earth.
It's a phenomenal technical problem, but this
year researchers at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico achieved a
breakthrough that looks set to transform the
way we keep our secrets.
