Cryptographers often describe code scenarios in
terms of a trio of characters called Alice, Bob
and Eve. While Alice is trying to send a sensitive
message to Bob, Eve is trying to eavesdrop. To
keep her message secret, Alice has to encrypt it,
and for this she can use a cipher known as a
on&time pad'. Cryptographers have known
about the onetime pad technique for decades
and it is logically uncrackable. The encryption
requires three separate stages. First, Alice
transforms her message into a series of 1s and
0s. Second, Alice creates a key-a random series
of 1s and 0s that is as long as the message.
Third, Alice adds each element of the key to the
corresponding element of the message, to create
an encrypted text also made up of 1s and 0s; the
only unusual adding rule is that 1 + 1 = 0.
Finally, Alice sends the encrypted text to Bob.






This type of code is impossible to crack because
each element of Alice's key is random. Even if
Eve were to use computational brute force to try
