To illustrate how a keyword is used in conjunction 
with the Vigenere square, let us encipher 'Divert 
troops to east ridge', using the keyword WHITE. 
First, the keyword is spelt out above the message, 
and repeated until each letter in the message is 
associated with a letter from the keyword. This 
can be done by clicking on 'Repeat Keyword'.

Above the first letter of the message, 'd', is the key 
letter, W. To encrypt this first letter, we go to the 
column headed by 'd' and then see where it 
intersects the row starting with W, which is at the 
letter Z. Consequently, the letter 'd' in the 
plaintext is represented by Z in the ciphertext. You 
can check this by clicking on 'Letter Encipher'.

This process is repeated to encrypt other letters in 
the message. The second letter is 'i', and above it 
is the key letter H. To encrypt 'i', we identify the 
column headed by 'i' and see where it intersects 
the row starting with H, which is at the letter P. 
Consequently, the letter 'i' in the plaintext is 
represented by P in the ciphertext. You can check 
the encryption of this letter and subsequent 
letters by clicking on 'Letter Encipher'.
