Samuel Morse built his first telegraph line 
spanning the 37 miles between Baltimore 
and Washington. Morse employed an 
electromagnet to enhance the signal, so 
that upon arriving at the receiver's end it 
was strong enough to make a series of 
short and long marks, dots and dashes, on 
a piece of paper. He also developed the 
now familiar Morse code for translating 
each letter of the alphabet into a series of 
dots and dashes. To complete his system, 
he designed a sounder, so that the receiver 
would hear each letter as a series of 
audible dots and dashes.
