Triple DES

Because DES is no longer secure (too few keys), serious cryptographers have resorted to Triple DES.
This requires two DES keys, which squares the key space from 56-bits (7.2 x 1018) to 112-bits

(5 x 10 ). The sender encrypts with the first key, then decrypts with the second key (which
scrambles the message even more), and then re=encrypts again with the first key, which scrambles
the text again and gets it into the right output format. Triple DES seems to be unbreakable for the
foreseeable future.

IDEA

IDEA is an encryption system developed by Dr. X. Lai and Prof. J. Massey in Switzerland in the
early 1990s. It also operates on 64 bit blocks at a time, just like DES, but with a key of 128 bits. This
key length makes it impossible to break by simply trying every key, and there is no known shortcut.
It is just one of many alternatives to DES, which also includes RC4, a cipher used in a number of
commercial systems like Lotus Notes and secure Netscape.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Because DES is no longer secure, a new Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is about to
be adopted, which will be known as the Advanced Encryption Standard. The hot candidate for the
new standard is Rijndael, developed by Belgian cryptographers Dr. Joan Daemen and Dr. Vincent
Rijmen. When adopted, the AES will offer three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits. In comparison,
DES keys are 56 bits long. To put this into perspective, if there was a machine that could crack DES
in 1 second, the same machine would take 150 thousand-billion years to crack a 128-bit AES key.
