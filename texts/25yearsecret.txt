It is extraordinary that the work of Ellis, Cocks
and Williamson was kept secret for two decades.
The GCHQ attitude seemed to be: "If there is
no need to go public, then why go public?"

Eventually, in 1997, GCHQ felt that there was
sufficient reason to go public, namely it wanted
to increase its public profile in order to generate
interest in its commercial services. At last, the
trio of British cryptographers could receive the
public credit that they deserved. Sadly, it was
too late for James Ellis, who died just a few
weeks before the announcement.
