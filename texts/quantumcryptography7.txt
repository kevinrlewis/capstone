It works like this. Alice needs to send a key to
Bob, which he can then use to decipher a future
coded message. To do this, Alice starts with two
polarising filters oriented at 0 degrees and +45
degrees, representing 0 and 1 respectively. Bob
has two similar polarising filters oriented at 90
degrees and -45 degrees. For the key, Alice sends
Bob a string of randomly polarised photons
representing 1s and 0s. Bob then tries to
measure the polarisation of each photon by
randomly switching between his two filters.

A photon striking a filter oriented in the same
direction will always pass through. Conversely, a
photon striking a filter oriented perpendicularly
will never pass through. But a photon hitting a
filter that is diagonal to its own orientation is in
a quantum quandary, with a 50:50 chance of
passing through or being blocked.
