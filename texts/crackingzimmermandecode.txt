We intend to begin unrestricted submarine warfare 
on the first of February. We shall endeavour in 
spite of this to keep the United States neutral. In 
the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico 
a proposal of alliance on the following basis: 
make war together, make peace together, generous 
financial support, and an understanding on our 
part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost 
territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The 
settlement in detail is left to you. 

You will inform the President [of Mexico] of the 
above most secretly, as soon as the outbreak of war 
with the United States is certain and add the 
on that he should, on his own initiative, invite 
Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time 
mediate between Japan and ourselves. 

Please call the President's attention to the fact 
that the unrestricted employment of our 
submarines now offers the prospect of compelling 
England to make peace within a few months. 
Acknowledge receipt.
