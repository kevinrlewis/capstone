Babbage was interested in ciphers from a very young age. He once recalled how his hobby 
occasionally got him into trouble: "The bigger boys made ciphers, but if I got hold of a few words, I 
usually found out the key. The consequence of this ingenuity was occasionally painful: the owners of 
the detected ciphers sometimes thrashed me, though the fault lay in their own stupidity." These 
beatings did not discourage him, and he wrote in his autobiography: "Deciphering is, in my opinion, 
one of the most fascinating of arts."

Babbage was inspired to crack the Vigenere cipher thanks to Jogn Thwaites, a Bristol dentist with a 
naive view of ciphers. In 1854, Thwaites wrote to the "Jounal of the Society of Arts" in order to 
patent his version of the Vigenere cipher, unaware that he was 250 years too late. Babbage wrote to 
the Society, pointing out that "the cipher ... is a very old one, and to be found in most books." 
Thwaites was unapologetic and challenged Babbage to break his cipher. Whether or not it was 
breakable was irrelevant to whether or not it was new, but Babbage was curious and searched for a 
weakness in the Vigenere cipher.
