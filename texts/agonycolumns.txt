In Victorian England, the open expression of affection between young couples was frowned upon. 
They could not even communicate by letter, fearing that their parents might intercept and read their 
correspondence. Therefore, sweethearts sent each other encrypted messages via the personal 
columns of newspapers.

These so-called "agony columns" provokes the curiosity of amateur codebreakers, who would scan 
the notes and try to decipher their titillating contents. The scientist Charles Wheatstone deciphered 
a note in The Times from an Oxford student, suggesting to his true love that they elope. Wheatstone 
inserted his own message, encrypted in the same cipher, advising the couple against the rash action. 
Then there appeared a third message, this time unencrypted: "Dear Charlie, Write no more. Our 
cipher is discovered."

The newspaper also contained other types of encrypted notes. In one case, The Times unwittingly 
carried the following encrypted notice: "The Times is the Jefferies of the press." The notice likened 
the newspaper to the notorious 17th century Judge Jeffreys, implyiing that the Times was a ruthless, 
bullying publication, which acted as a mouthpiece for the government.
