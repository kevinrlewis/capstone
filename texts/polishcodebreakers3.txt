However, the fact that the setting was encoded twice 
was a foolish and unnecessary repetition. Codebreakers 
thrive on repetition, indeed patterns of any kind. By 
analysing encoded repeated settings, Rejewski could 
crack the Enigma cipher for much of the 1930s.

Slight modifications to the Enigma machine meant that 
the Poles could no longer eavesdrop on German 
communications at the outbreak of World War Two. 
Nevertheless, their breakthroughs provided a valuable 
platform for the Allies. In the weeks before Warsaw was 
invaded, the Poles astonished British codebreakers by 
revealing their achievements and handing over two 
replica machines.
