A secure cipher system must have a wide range of potential keys. For example, if 
the sender uses the Caesar shift cipher to encrypt a message, then encryption is 
relatively weak because there are only 25 potential keys. From the enemy's point 
of view, if they intercept the message and suspect that the algorithm being used 
is the Caesar shift, then they merely have to check the 25 possibilities.

However, if the sender uses the more general substitution algorithm, which 
permits the cipher alphabet to be any rearrangement of the plain alphabet, then 
there are 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possibly keys. If the enemy 
intercepts a message and know which algorithm has been used, then there is 
still the horrendous challenge of checking all possible keys.
