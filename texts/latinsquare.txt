One example of a transposition cipher is this series of five 
5-letter words arranged in a square, found on the walls of 
Roman villas in Pompeii and CIrencester.

The square reads `rotas opera tenet arepo sator', which 
roughly means `he who guides the plough sows the seed', You 
might notice that the square is highly symmetrical - it can be 
read left to right, right to left, upwards and downwards.

However, this harmless symmetrical motto disguises a much 
more important message, which can be found by transposing 
the letters.

After rearranging the letters in the latin square we have: 

1. `Paternoster' repeated twice, which means `our father'.

2. The paternosters form a cross, which has Christian significance.

3. Left over are A's and O's, representing the alpha and the 
omega, the beginning and the end, also of Christian 
significance.

It is thought that the latin square was put on the side of 
houses which offered refuge to Christians, who were the only 
people who knew how to transpose the letters and obtain the 
real meaning of the square.

Strangely, some historians think that the latin square is even 
older than the Christian Church.
