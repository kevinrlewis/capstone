Some codes we constructed in alphabetical and 
numerical order, so that words beginning with A 
are represented by low numbers, and words beginning 
with Z are represented by high numbers. So if the 
enemy uses intelligence information that suggests 
that 7856 is SUN and that 7858 is SUNSET, then 
they can deduce that 7857 is SUNRISE. 

And, if the same edition of the code book is 
being used year after year, then sooner or later a 
copy will be captured by the enemy, thereby 
undermining the security of the code and every 
subsequent message that is encoded. With ciphers, 
a different key can be used each day. If one key 
is captured, then security is compromised for 
just one day.
