Throughout the war, Bletchley Park and its
achievements remained a closely guarded
secret. Those on the ground that benefited
from Ultra intelligence had no idea of its
source. Furthermore, all Ultra information
was exploited in such a way that it did not
arouse suspicion in Berlin. If Bletchley
warned of a U-boat at a certain location,
then a spotter plane would be sent out
before the U-boat was attacked. That way,
the Germans assumed that it was the spotter
plane that inspired the attack, and they did
not suspect that their code had been broken.
