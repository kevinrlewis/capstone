Thomas Brierley's gravestone in Mellor Churchyard in 
Cheshire is a good example of the use of the pigpen cipher 
by Freemasons in the 18th century. Notice the Masonic 
square and compass symbols. It is difficult to decipher the 
text due to the weathering of the gravestone. The ciphertext 
also seems to use a non-standard symbol for the letter "S". 
The text at the head of the stone appears to say "Thomas 
Brierley made his ingress July 16th 1785".
