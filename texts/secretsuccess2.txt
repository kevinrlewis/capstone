After the war, Bletchley's accomplishments were still classified. Britain wanted to continue its
intelligence operations, and was reluctant to divulge its capabilities. In fact, Britain had captured
hundreds of Enigmas and distributed them among its former colonies, who believed that the cipher
was as secure as it had seemed to the Germans. The British did nothing to jeopardise this belief.

While those who fought conventional battles could talk of their heroic achievements, those who
fought intellectual battles of no less significance remained silent. Many codebreakers, including
Alan Turing, died without any public acknowledgement of their vital contribution to the war effort.

The secrecy over Bletchley Park eventually came to an end in the early 1970s. Captain F.W.
Winterbotham, who had been responsible for distributing the Ultra intelligence, received permission
to publish "The Ultra Secret". Bletchley codebreaker Gordon Welchman felt enormous relief:
After the war I still avoided discussions of wartime events for fear that I might reveal information
obtained from Ultra rather than from some published account... I felt that this tum of events
released me from my wartime pledge of secrecy."
