Phil Zimmermarm has probably done more
than anybody else to encourage the use of
cryptography and spark a debate about the
politics of privacy: “Cryptography used to be
an obscure science, of little relevance to
everyday life. Historically, it always had a
special role in military and diplomatic
communications. But in the Information Age,
cryptography is about political power, and in
particular, about the power relationship
between a government and its people. It is
about the right to privacy, freedom of speech,
freedom of political association, freedom of
the press, freedom from unreasonable search
and seizure, freedom to be left alone.”

Zimmermarm is best known for developing the Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) encryption system. Initially, the American
establishment tried to restrict its export and Zimmermarm
was at the centre of a major investigation, but PGP is now
widely available and Zimmermarm is one of the best know
advocates for cryptography.
