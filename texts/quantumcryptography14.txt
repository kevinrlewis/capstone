Turbulence typically occurs on a scale of tens of
centimetres, so 770 nanometres is short enough
to avoid this.

That still leaves plenty of other problems. For
instance, as the satellite tries to detect Alice's
photons, there is the risk of being swamped by
background photons, either coming directly
from the Sun or reflected from the Earth or
Moon. To prevent this, the Los Alamos group
has designed a highly directional receiver that
only picks up photons arriving from Alice's
direction. It also includes a filter to ensure that
only photons of the correct frequency are
accepted.

To exclude any remaining extraneous photons
that happen to come from the right direction
with the right frequency, the detector only
accepts photons that arrive during a time
window of 5 nanoseconds each microsecond.
The window has to be open when Alice's photon
arrives.
