For example, in North Africa, Ultra helped to destroy German supply lines and informed the Allies of the status of
General Rommel's forces, enabling the Eighth Army to fight back against the German advances. Ultra also warned
of the German invasion of Greece, which allowed British troops to retreat without heavy losses. In fact, Ultra
provided reports on the enemy's situation throughout the Mediterranean. This was particularly valuable when the
Allies landed in Italy and Sicily in 1943. In 1944, Ultra played a major role in the Allied invasion of Europe. In the
months prior to D-Day, it provided a detailed picture of the German troop concentrations along the French coast.
Stuart Milner-Barry, one of the Hut 6 cryptanalysts, wrote: "I do not imagine that any war since classical times, if
ever, has been fought in which one side read consistently the main military and naval intelligence of the other."

It has been controversially argued that Bletchley Park was the decisive factor in the Allied victory. What is certain
is that Ultra significantly shortened the war. This is evident by re-running the Battle of Atlantic without the benefit
of Ultra intelligence. To begin with, more ships and supplies would have been lost to the dominant U-boat fleet,
compromising the vital link to America and forcing the Allies to divert manpower into the building of new ships.
Historians have estimated that this would have me ant postponing the D-Day invasion by at least a year.

According to Sir Harry Hinsley: "My own belief is that the war, instead of finishing in 1945, would have ended in
1948 had the Government Code and Cypher School not been able to read the Enigma cyphers and produce the Ultra
intelligence." During this period of delay, additional lives would have been lost in Europe on both sides, and Hitler
would have been able to make greater use of his V-weapons, inflicting damage throughout southern England.
