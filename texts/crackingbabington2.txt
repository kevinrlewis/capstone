At this point Walsingham could have pounced on 
Babington, but he wanted more than the execution 
of a handful of rebels. He bidded his time in the hope 
that Mary would reply and authorise the plot, 
thereby incriminating herself. On 17th July, Mary 
replied to Babington, effectively signing her own 
death warrant. She explicitly wrote about the 
"design", showing particular concern that she 
should be released before Elizabeth's assassination 
to avoid the possibility that she might be murdered 
by her jailer.

The video clip shows how Phelippes would have 
tackled the encrypted letters.
