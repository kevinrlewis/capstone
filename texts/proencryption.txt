- Universal Declaration of Human Rights , article 12: “No one shall be subjected to
arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to
attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of
the law against such interference or attacks.”

- Encryption has enabled the e-commerce revolution. Information, such as credit
cards, could not be exchanged on the Internet without encryption.

- Encryption cuts crime because it makes it harder for criminals to steal information.

- Encryption hinders the development of a Big Brother society in which the authorities
can spy on the rest of us.

- Encryption is essential in an age when there is so much information and it is so
easily gathered. Phil Zimmermarm points out: “Today, electronic mail is gradually
replacing conventional paper mail. Unlike paper mail, e-mail messages are just too
easy to intercept and scan for interesting keywords.”
