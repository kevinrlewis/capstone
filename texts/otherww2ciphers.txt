Communications between Hitler and his generals were encrypted using the Lorenz SZ40 machine,
which operated in a similar way to the Enigma machine, but was far more complicated, presenting
the Bletchley codebreakers with an even greater challenge. Eventually, a GPO engineer Tommy
Flowers constructed a machine, Colossus, for breaking the Lorenz cipher. The machine was based
on a design by a Bletchley mathematician Max Newman, which drew heavily on the ideas of Alan
Turing. Its 1,500 electronic valves were considerably faster than the sluggish electromechanical
relay switches used in the bombes. But more important than Colossusâ€™ speed was the fact that it
was programmable. It is this that makes Colossus the precursor to the modern digital computer.
