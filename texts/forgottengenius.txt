Babbage's successful cryptanalysis of the Vigenere cipher was probably achieved in 1854, but his 
discovery went completely unrecognised, because he never published it. The discovery only came to 
light this century. In the meantime, his teclunique was independently discovered by Friedrich 
WiThehn Kasisld, a retired officer in the Prussian army. Ever since 1863, when he published his 
cryptanalftic breakthrough in "Die Gehehnschriften and die Dechiffrir Isunst" (Secret Writing and 
the Art of Deciphering), the teclunique has been Imam as the Kasisld Test, and Babbage's 
contribution has been largely ignored.
