Babbage never finished building 'Difference 
Engine No.2', nor its successor the 'Analytical 
Engine'. The design for the latter provides the 
blueprint for modern computers, so Babbage is 
considered to be the first pioneer of computing.

The video clip shows the Difference Engine at the 
Science Museum in London, built by Doron 
Swade in the 1990s. The machine works perfectly 
and is a tribute to Babbage's genius.
