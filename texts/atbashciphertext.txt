Medieval monks were intrigued by the fact that the Old Testament 
contained deliberate and obvious examples of cryptography. For example, 
the Old Testament includes pieces of text encrypted with atbash, a 
traditional form of Hebrew substitution cipher. Atbash involves taking 
each letter, noting its position in the alphabet, and replacing it with 
a letter that is an equal number of places from the end of the alphabet. 
In English this would mean that ``a'', one place from the beginning of 
the alphabet, is replaced by ``z'', one place from the end of the 
alphabet, ``b'' is replaced by ``Y'', and so on. The term atbash itself 
hints at the substitution it describes, because it consists of the first 
letter of the Hebrew alphabet, aleph, followed by the last letter taw, 
and then there is the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, beth, followed 
by the second to last letter shin.

An example of atbash appears in Jeremiah 25:26 and 51:41, were Babel is replaced 
by the word Sheshach; the first letter of Babel is beth, the second letter of the 
Hebrew alphabet, and this is replaced by shin, the second to last letter of the 
Hebrew alphabet; the second letter of Babel is also beth, as Hebrew traditionally 
did not include symbols for vowels, and so it too is replaced by shin; and the last 
letter of Babel is lamed, the twelfth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and this is 
replaced by kaph, the twelfth letter from the end of the Hebrew alphabet.
