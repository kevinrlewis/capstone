However, the basic principle is the 
same across all types of Enigma 
machine. In this section we will look 
at how to use the "3 wheel Army/ 
Air Force" Enigma.

We will look at what the key is, how 
many keys there are, and how they 
are agreed between sender and 
receiver.

Finally, you will be able to encrypt 
messages using the fully functioning 
emulation of the Army/Air Force 3 
wheel Enigma. The emulator will
allow you to pick keys and encrypt 
messages, while watching the 
encryption process in action.
