A digraph cipher encrypts by 
substituting each digraph (i.e., pair 
of letters) in the message with a 
different digraph or symbol. In the 
digraph cipher shown here, each 
plaintext digraph is substituted 
with a digraph from the square. For 
example, 'as' is encrypted by 
finding the intersection of the 
column headed by 'a' with the row 
headed by 's', which gives us NO. 
So, the plaintext digraph 'as' is 
substituted with the ciphertext 
digraph NO.
To encipher a message, type it into 
the plaintext box, click the button 
labeled 'Form Digraphs', and then 
click 'Encipher'.
