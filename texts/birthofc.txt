Ever since humans began sending each other secret messages, 
they have been writing in code. Whether those messages are 
military plans, sensitive blueprints or love letters, encrypting the 
communication can protect it from prying eyes.

Hence, for thousands of years we have been inventing codes, and 
when those were broken we set about inventing better codes. The 
search for the unbreakable code continues today.

However, this section describes some of the earliest forms of 
encryption. It also describes how cryptogaphy (the science of 
codes and codebreaking) has changed history, culminating in the 
tragic tale of Mary Queen of Scots, whose life depended on the 
strength of her cipher.

Cryptography can be divided into two branches, known as 
transposition and substitution. In transposition, the letters of the 
message are simply rearranged, effectively generating an anagram. 
Click the top button on the right to explore the topic of 
transposition ciphers further. Substitution ciphers involve the 
replacement of each letter by another letter or symbol. Clicking 
the second button will give you access to more information about 
substitution ciphers.
