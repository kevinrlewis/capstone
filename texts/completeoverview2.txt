   • how the plugboard has been wired

   • the position of each rotor, e.g., put 
     rotor no. 1 in position 2, rotor no. 2 in 
     position 3 and rotor no. 3 in position 1. 

   • the orientation of each rotor, e.g., 
     rotate rotor 1 to position 15, rotor 2 to 
     position 7, and rotor 3 to position 25 

   • the positions of the kick-over point on 
     the first two rotors, which determine
     when rotor will bump its neighbour
     forward one place.

Crucially, the rotors, which determine the path 
of the current and the way a letter is encrypted,
move every time letter is encrypted, so the
mode or encryption changes.
