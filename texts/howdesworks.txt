The message is translated into a long string of binary
digits. Encryption could be performed bit by bit, but in
the case of DES the string of bits is clustered into
blocks of 64. Each 64-bit block is encrypted separately.
Focusing on just one block, the 64 bits are shuffled,
and then split into two half-blocks of 32, labelled Left0
and Right0. The bits in Right0 are then put through a
‘mangler function', which changes the bits according to
a complex substitution. The mangled Right0 is then
added to Left0 to create a new half-block of 32 bits
called Right1. The original Right0 is relabeled Left1.
This set of operations is called a ‘round'.

The whole process is repeated during a second round,
but starting with the new half-blocks, Left1 and Right1,
and ending with Left2 and Right1. This process is
repeated until there have been 16 rounds in total.

The details of the mangler function depend on

(K1, K2,...K16). These are determined by a key agreed
by the sender and the receiver. In other words, the same
message can be encrypted in a myriad of different ways
depending on which key is chosen. Although the key is
basically 56 bits, it often looks like 64 bits, because
there are an additional 8 bits, known as check bits, that
help to reduce errors.

Decryption occurs by using the same key and reversing
the entire process, from round 16 back to round 1.
