But this causes another problem - and again it's
turbulence that is at the root of it. Even if it
doesn't change the polarisation of the photons,
turbulence does affect how fast they travel. This
leads to 'jitter' -a continual variation in the
journey time. To compensate for jitter, a pulse
of light is sent 100 nanoseconds ahead of each
photon. This timing pulse is affected by the
atmosphere in exactly the same way as the
photon that follows. So whenever a pulse
arrives, the satellite knows that the photon will
be coming 100 nanoseconds later and times the
opening of the window accordingly.
