- Typing the same letter twice does NOT 
  illuminate the same letters on the lampboard.
  Each keystroke changes the internal setting of 
  the machine, so typing the same letter again 
  usually results in a different output.

- There are billions of possible machine settings 
  (i.e., keys), so the same message can be 
  encrypted in billions of different ways. Even if 
  an eavesdropper has an Enigma machine, they 
  still need to discover the correct key in order to 
  decipher a message.
