In addition to analysing the frequency of individual letters, here are some other tips for cracking a 
message encrypted with the monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

  -  If you are having trouble cracking a message, then focus on repeated letters. In 
     English, the most common repeated letters are 'ss', 'ee', 'tt', 'ff', 'll', 'mm' and 'oo', 
     in that order. If the ciphertext contains any repeated characters, then they probably 
     represent one of these.

  -  If the ciphertext contains spaces between words, then try to identify words 
     containing just one, two or three letters, The only one-letter words in English are: 'a' 
     and 'i'. The most common two-letter words are: 'of', 'to', 'in', 'it', 'is', 'be', 'as', 'at', 
     'so', 'we', 'he', 'by', 'or', 'on' and 'do'. The most common three-letter words are: 
     'the' and 'and'.

  -  The following trick works even when the ciphertext does not contain spaces between 
     words. The trick allows us to spot the letter 'h', having already identified the letter 
     'e'. In English, 'h' frequently goes before 'e' (as in 'the', 'then', 'they'), but rarely 
     after 'e'. No other pair of letters has such an asymmetric relationship. Find a 
     ciphertext letter that has a highly asymmetric relationship with the letter that you 
     think represents 'e', and this is probably 'h'.

  -  A useful skill is the ability to guess words or entire phrases in a ciphertext based on 
     experience. Al Khalil, an early Arabian cryptanalyst, demonstrated this talent when 
     he cracked a Greek ciphertext. He guessed that the ciphertext began with the 
     greeting 'In the name of God'. Having established that this phrase corresponded to 
     specific letters in the ciphertext, he could prise open the rest of the ciphertext. A 
     section of ciphertext that can be guessed is known as a 'crib'.
