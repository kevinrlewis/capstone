The battle for secure communication in World War One began before dawn on the 
first day. The British ship Telconia approached the German coast under cover 
of darkness, dropped anchor and hauled up a clutch of undersea cables. These 
were Germany's transatlantic cables, its communications link to the rest of the 
world. By the time the sun had risen, they had been severed. This act of 
sabotage was aimed at destroying Germany's most secure means of communication, 
thereby forcing German messages to be sent via insecure radio links or via 
cables owned by other countries.

As the war progressed, on both sides there was a constant striving for stronger 
and better forms or encryption. For example, the Germans employed the ADFGVX 
cipher, developed as the result of a competition held to increase their 
military security. Perhaps more importantly, there was widespread 
use of codes.
