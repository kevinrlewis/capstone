Digital Signatures

How does the receiver know that the message 
was sent by me? I need what is known as a 
digital signature. This can be achieved by 
encrypting my message with my private key, 
which can only be decrypted by my public key, 
therefore the message must be from me, because 
only I have access to my private key.

Non-repudiation

Sometimes the sender merely wants to know 
that the message has arrived safely, so that the 
receiver cannot deny having seen the message. 
Cryptography can enable this.
