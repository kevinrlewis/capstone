Codes are incredibly hard to break and have been used 
throughout history. However, people have generally 
avoided using them if at all possible, because it 
requires so much work to construct a code book, print 
it and then distribute it. Remember, a code book may 
contain hundreds of pages, whereas a cipher key might 
be just 26 letters. When the telegraph was invented, 
code books were used as a way of saving money. A whole 
sentence might be substituted by a 5-letter code 
group, and it would be much cheaper to transmit 5 
letters than a whole sentence. During World War One 
codes became central to the secure communication by 
all combatants. To find out more about constructing code 
books and their security, watch the video clip.
