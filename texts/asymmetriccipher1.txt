In 1975, Diffie concocted a new type of cipher, one that incorporated a so-called
asymmetric key. So far, all the encryption techniques described have been symmetric,
i.e., the unscrambling process is simply the opposite of scrambling. For example, the
Enigma machine uses a certain key setting to encipher a message, and the receiver uses
an identical machine in the same key setting to decipher it.

In contrast, in an asymmetric cipher, as the name suggests, the encryption key and the
decryption key are not identical. In the case of an asymmetric cipher, if Alice knows
the encryption key then she can encrypt a message, but she cannot decrypt a message.
In order to decrypt, Alice must have access to the decryption key.

At this point it is worth stressing that Diffie had invented the general concept of an
asymmetric cipher, but he did not have an example of one. However, the mere concept
of an asymmetric cipher was revolutionary.
