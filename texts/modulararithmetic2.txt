In fact, we do modular arithmetic whenever we talk about time. If it is 9 o'clock now, and we have
a meeting 8 hours from now, then we say that the meeting is at 5 o'clock, not 17 o'clock. We have
mentally calculated that 9 + 8 = 5 in (mod 12).

Rather than visualising clocks, mathematicians take the short cut of performing modular
calculations in normal arithmetic, then to work out the answer in (mod x) divide the normal answer
by x and note the remainder. This remainder is the answer in (mod x). To find out 5 x 4 (mod 7), we
do the following: 5 â€˜X 4 _ 20
