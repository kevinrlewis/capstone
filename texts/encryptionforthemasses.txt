Although the telegraph and the ensuing telecommunications revolution occurred in 
the 19th century, its origins can be traced back to 1753. An anonymous letter in a 
Scottish magazine described how a message could be sent by connecting the sender 
and receiver with 26 cables. The sender could spell out the message by sending pulses 
of electricity along each wire. To spell out "hello", the sender would begin by sending 
a signal down the "h" wire, then down the "e" wire, and so on. The receiver would 
somehow sense the electrical current emerging from each wire and read the message.

However, this "expeditious method of conveying intelligence" was never constructed 
because of several technical obstacles. For example, engineers needed a sufficiently 
sensitive system for detecting electrical signals. In England, Charles Wheatstone and 
William Cooke built detectors from magnetised needles, which were deflected by an 
incoming electric current. By 1839, the Wheatstone-Cooke system was being used to 
send messages 18 miles between railway stations in West Drayton and Paddington

The reputation of the telegraph and its remarkable speed of communication soon 
spread. Nothing did more to popularise its power than the birth of Queen Victoria's 
second son, Prince Alfred, at Windsor on 6 August 1844. News of the birth was 
telegraphed to London, and The Times was on the streets announcing the news within 
the hour. It credited the technology that had enabled this feat, mentioning that it was 
"indebted to the extraordinary power of the Electro-Magnetic Telegraph." The 
following year, the telegraph gained further fame when it helped capture John Tawell, 
who had murdered his mistress in Slough, and who had attempted to escape by 
jumping on a train to London. The local police telegraphed Tawell's description to 
London, and he was arrested as soon as he arrived at Paddington.
