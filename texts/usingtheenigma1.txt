Now that we have seen how Enigma works, we can see how it was used.

Be aware that there were several types of Enigma machine, and they were used in 
many different ways. For example, the earliest versions of the Enigma did not have a 
plugboard. The naval machine was different from the army machine, and eventually 
the naval Enigma narrowed the reflector, leaving room for a fourth rotor, which was 
adjustable but which did not move during encryption.
