An example of the public familiarity with cryptography was the widespread use of pinprick 
encryption. The ancient Greek historian Aeneas the Tactician suggested conveying a secret message 
by procking tiny holes under particular letters in an apparently innocuous page of text, just as there 
are dots under some letters in this paragraph. The punctured letters would spell out a secret 
message, easily read by the intended receiver. However, if an intermediary stared at the page, they 
would probably be oblivious to the barely perceptible pinpricks, and would be unaware of the secret 
message.

Two thousand years later, British letter writers used exactly the same method, not to achieve 
secrecy, but to avoid paying excessive postage costs. Before the overhaul of the postage system in 
the mid-1800s, sending a letter cost about a shilling for every hundred miles, beyond the means of 
most people, but newspapers were allowed to travel free, and this provided a loophole for the thrifty 
Victorian. Instead of writing and sending letters, people began to use pinpricks to spell out a 
message on the front page of a newspaper. They could then send the newspaper through the post, 
without having to pay a penny.
