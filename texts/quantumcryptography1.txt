IT COULD happen in a few months or a few
years. But sooner or later, a mathematician
could make a discovery that jeopardises
international security, threatens the future of
Internet commerce, and imperils the privacy of
emails. Today's codes and ciphers are good, to
be sure. But it is probably only a matter of time
before they become useless.

With the coming of the information age, we rely
ever more heavily on cryptography to protect us
from snoopers, cyber-crooks and Big Brother.
Some of today's most secure codes exploit the
fact that while it is easy to multiply two prime
numbers together, it is almost impossible to
start with the answer and work out which two
primes were used to create it. But the day a
mathematical genius discovers a short cut for
finding the hidden prime numbers, these codes
will crumble.
