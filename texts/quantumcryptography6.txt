To avoid being spotted, Eve would have to
retransmit the photon to Bob. However, because
of the strange way that quantum particles work,
Eve does not always measure the same
polarisation that Alice sent. That in tum means
that she cannot be sure that she is retransmitting
the correct orientation.

Thus Eve's interception will inevitably affect the
transmission of the key, and Alice and Bob
should be able to spot this, discard the key, and
try again with a new one.

The system is perfect, apart from one problem.
If Eve cannot accurately read the key, then how
can Bob? In 1984, Bennett and Brassard were
chatting on the platform at Croton-Harmon
station in New York state, near IBM's Watson
Laboratories in Yorktown Heights, when they
hit on the answer. Waiting for the train that
would take Brassard back to Montreal, they
invented the first workable form of quantum
cryptography. The Bennett-Brassard
communications protocol requires the use of
four polarising filters for Alice and four for
Bob, but it was superseded in 1992 by a simpler
system that requires only two filters each.
