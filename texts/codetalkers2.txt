Commanding officers became "war chiefs", platoons became 
"mud-clans", fortifications became "cave dwellings" and 
mortars were know as "guns that squat". Even though the 
complete lexicon contained 274 words, there would still be a 
problem in translating unpredictable words or the names of 
people and places. The solution was to devise an encoded 
alphabet for spelling out difficult words. For example, the 
word Pacific would be spelt out as (Pig, Ant, Cat, Ice, Fox, 
Ice, Cat), which would then be translated into Navajo as 
(Bi-sodih, Wol-la-chee, Moasi, Tkin, Ma-e, Tkin, Moase).
