Like Diffie, Ellis could not think of a
mathematical implementation, so the idea lay
dormant for three years. Eventually, in 1973,
Clifford Cocks joined CESG. Having just
completed his PhD in maths, but knowing very
little about cryptography, he tackled the
problem and came up with the equivalent
solution that Rivest, Shamir and Adleman
would later develop in 1977.
