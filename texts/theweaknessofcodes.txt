In theory, codes are virtually unbreakable. In practice, codes can be broken, and were broken.

The fundamental weakness of codes is that code books we rarely changed. Code books are so huge that users we 
reluctant to compile, print and distribute new code books, and instead use old code books for many years. This 
gives codebreakers time to exploit chinks in the code armour. 

For example, if a coded message is intercepted by the enemy at midnight and they receive intelligence the 
following day staling that a ship left port at 23.55, then they deduce that the elements of the coded message 
represent words like ship, depart, port, 23 and 55. By cross-checking intelligence with coded messages, the 
enemy can gradually compile their own copy of the code book
