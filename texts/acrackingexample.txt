Babbage defined a series of steps to crack the Vigenere cipher. Let us try to decipher ciphertext 
below. We know that it was enciphered using the Vigenere cipher, but we know nothing about the 
original message or the keyword. The first step is to search for sequences of letters that appear 
more than once in the ciphertext. The most likely reason for such repetitions is that the sync 
sequence of letters in the plaintext has been enciphered using the sync part of the key. You can 
print the ciphertext and search for repetitions by hand or dick 'Find Repeated Sequences'.
