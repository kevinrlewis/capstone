The problem with a single rotor is that it gets back to 
where it started after just 6 letters (or 26 letters with a 
full alphabet), and the pattern of encryption repeats. 
Repetition leads to a weak cipher, so to avoid this 
problem the real Enigma has 3 (or sometimes 4) 
rotors. Each rotor has a kicking tooth so when it 
completes a revolution it kicks the neat rotor forward 
one place. So when the first rotor is back where it 
started, the next one will be fornmd one place, so the 
pattern of encryption will be different.
The rotors behave just like a mileometre on a car. You 
can see how it works by encrypting the message above, 
or encrypting a message of your own. Notice that the 
same letter will usually be encrypted differently, 
because the rotors will be in a different position.
