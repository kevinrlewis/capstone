The alternative to transposition is substitution, whereby each letter is 
substituted by a different letter or symbol. Examples of substitution 
ciphers can be explored by clicking the buttons on the right.

The first documented use of a substitution cipher for military 
purposes appears in Julius Caesar's "Gallic Wars". Caesar describes 
how he sent a message to Cicero, who was besieged and on the verge 
of surrendering. The substitution replaced Roman letters with Greek 
letters, rendering the message unintelligible to the enemy.

Caesar described the dramatic delivery of the message: "If he could 
not approach the camp, the messenger was instructed to hurl a spear 
into the entrenchment of the camp, with the letter fastened to the 
spear's thong, ... Fearing danger, the gaul discharged the spear, as he 
had been instructed. By chance it stuck fast in the tower, and for two 
days was not sighted by our troops; on the third day it was sighted by 
a soldier, taken down, and delivered to Cicero. He read it through and 
then recited it at a parade of the troops, bringing the greatest rejoicing 
to all."

Caesar used secret writing so frequently that Valerius Probus wrote an 
entire treatise on his ciphers, which unfortunately has not survived. 
However, thanks to Suetonius's "Lives of the Caesars LVI", written in 
the 2nd century AD, we do have a detailed description of one of the 
types of substitution cipher used by Caesar. To see how this cipher
