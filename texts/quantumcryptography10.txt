Suppose that Alice sends a 0° photon,
representing a 0 bit, and Eve measures it using a
-45° filter. If the photon is blocked, Eve does
not know if this is because the photon was +45°,
and so stood no chance of passing through, or
because it was at 0° and she was unlucky. Eve
might take a guess that it was a +45° photon,
and create and transmit such a photon onto
Bob. If Bob measured it using his 90° filter, the
photon might pass through-and if it did he
would incorrectly interpret Alice's photon as
representing a 1 bit.

Bob's misinterpretation can be used to expose
Eve's nefarious interception. To see if Eve has
been listening, Alice and Bob check for errors.
After establishing a tentative key, they pick
some of the bits at random and declare their
values over the telephone to see whether they
agree. If there is any discrepancy, they assume
that Eve has been eavesdropping and they
abandon the key and start again. If there is no
discrepancy, they assume that it is safe to use
the key as the basis for encrypting a message
having first discarded those bits that they
disclosed during the error-checking procedure.
