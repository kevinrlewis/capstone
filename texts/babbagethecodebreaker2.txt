Cracking a difficult cipher is akin to climbing a 
sheer cliff face. The cryptanalyst is seeking any 
nook or cranny, which could provide the slightest 
purchase. In a monoalphabetic cipher the 
cryptanalyst will latch on to the frequency of the 
letters, because the most popular letters will stand 
out no matter how they have been disguised. In 
the Vigenere cipher the frequencies are much more 
balanced, so the rock face seems perfectly smooth, 
but Babbage was undaunted. In the video clip, 
Babbage's biographer Doron Swade talks about 
his dogged determination.
