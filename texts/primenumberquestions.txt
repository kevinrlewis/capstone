Prime numbers are at the heart of the RSA algorithm. In fact, primes are
central to much of mathematics because all numbers are primes or multiples
of primes (e.g. you can create 133 by multiplying 19 and 7). You can think of
primes as the building blocks of mathematics.

There are so many interesting things relating to prime numbers that it could
easily fill an entire CD-ROM, but we can only devote this page to the subject,
providing you with links to some interesting websites.
