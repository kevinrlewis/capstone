The Enigma also has a reflector, so the signal
passes through the rotors, hits the reflector and
then returns through the rotors before it reaches
the lampboard. Because the reflector sends the
signal back down a different path, it is
impossible for a letter to be encrypted as itself.
The advantage of the reflector is that encryption
and decryption become mirror processes. If B is
encrypted as D, then in the same setting D
would be decrypted as B. The letters B and D
are partnered up via the reflector.
