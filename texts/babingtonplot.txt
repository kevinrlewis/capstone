By 1586, after 18 years of imprisonment, Mary's morale was at its lowest and it seemed that all hope 
was lost. Then, on the 6th of January 1586, she received an astonishing package of letters. It was the 
first of a series of deliveries, smuggled by Gilbert Gifford into Chartley Hall in Staffordshire, where 
Mary was held prisoner.

Gifford had previously made contact with Anthony Babington, a young Catholic rebel who wanted 
Mary's blessing to plan a revolt, which involved assassinating Elizabeth and putting Mary on the 
throne. Via Gifford, Babington sent letters to Mary, which outlined his plan. In case the letters fell 
into the wrong hands, Babington encrypted his messages using a relatively straightforward 
monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

Instead of substituting each letter for a different letter, the cipher substituted each letter for a 
symbol. The cipher was used within elite Catholic circles, so Mary's cipher secretary, who was 
imprisoned with her, knew how to decipher Babington's letters.
