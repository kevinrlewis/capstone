The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses block ciphers. 
It was created by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. AES was designed to be efficient 
in both hardware and software, and it supports a block length of 128 bits and key lengths of 128, 192, and 
256 bits.
