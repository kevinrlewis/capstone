Between the keyboard and the first rotor, the
Enigma contains a plugboard. Several cables, with a
plug at either end, can be used to plug pairs of
letters. If A is plugged with B, then upon typing the
letter A, the current follows the path usually
associated with the letter B, and vice versa.

The plugboard settings change the way a message is
encrypted, and with the real Enigma there are a huge
number of possible settings, as you will see later. By
changing the plugboard settings on the Enigma
above, you can see how the word CAFE is encrypted
differently, even if the scramblers are reset to the
same setting.
