You can think of codebreaking in terms or solving the equation above. In general, this equation is 
tough to solve because it has two unknowns. All you know is the ciphertext that you have 
intercepted, and you have no idea of the key and the plaintext, the latter being your ultimate goal.

However, if you can guess a bit of the plaintext, then you have an equation with only one unknown. 
Solving an equation with only one unknown is much easier. Once you have deduced the key, you 
can decipher the complete message, and any other messages encrypted using the same key.

Finding cribs is difficult, but the task was made easier for codebreakers at Bletchley Park because of 
the way that the Enigma machine works. Let's use an example in English to illustrate how a crib was 
found for Enigma messages.

Codebreakers might suspect that a message sent at 6.15 in the morning contains a reference to the 
time, so the challenge is to match the phrase `zerosixonefive' with the correct bit of ciphertext. 
Crucially, the Enigma cipher can never encrypt a letter as itself. So the plaintext can be slid along 
and compared to the ciphertext until no letters match. Any comparison that satisfies this 
requirement might be a crib.
