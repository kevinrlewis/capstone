The invention of cryptanalysis partly depended on the growth of religious scholarship. Theologians 
studied the Hadith, which consists of the Prophet's daily utterances. They tried to demonstrate that 
each statement was indeed attributable to Muhammad. This was done by studying the etymology of 
words and structure of sentences, in order to test whether particular texts were consistent with the 
linguistic patterns of the Prophet.

The religious scholars did not stop their scrutiny at the level of words. They also analysed individual 
letters, and in particular they discovered that some letters are more common than others. The letters 
"a" and "l" are the most common in Arabic, partly because of the definite article "al-", whereas the 
letter "j" appears ten times less frequently. This apparently innocuous observation would lead to the 
first great breakthrough in cryptanalysis.
