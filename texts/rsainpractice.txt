RSA is a mathematical algorithm for
encryption. It is pure mathematics, but it
has to live in the real world, so
implementing RSA or any other form of
public key cryptography requires a great
deal of extra thinking. The websites on this
page discuss some of the points that need to
be considered if you are implementing RSA.
