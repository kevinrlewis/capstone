The most famous illustration of a broken code is the cracking of the Zimmermann Telegram.

In January 1917, the German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann seent a telegram to the President of 
Mexico, proposing an alliance. Germany's worst fear was that America would enter the First World 
War, tipping the balance in favour of Britain, so the telegram said that if America entered the 
European conflict, then Germany would support a Mexican attack on America's southern border to 
reclaim disputed states such as Texas and New Mexico. Zimmermann assumed that this would be enough 
to force America to withdraw its troops back to home soil in order to defend itself against 
Mexico.

The telegram was encoded to protect it from prying eyes, but the British intercepted it and sent it 
to its secret codebreaking department known as Room 40, where Nigel de Grey was responsible for 
cracking it. De Grey revealed Zimmermann's scheme by using the techniques described in the next two 
sections (`Cracking Zimmermann' and `The Weaknesses of Codes').
