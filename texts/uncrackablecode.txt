The invention of frequency analysis meant that the substitution cipher was no 
longer secure. A lack of security could lead to disasters such as the execution of 
Mary Queen of Scots. By the end of the sixteenth century, the codebreakers were 
clearly on top, so the codemakers had to devise a new form of encryption.

This chapter focuses on the Vigenere cipher, also known as the 'le chiffre 
indechiffrable', or the 'uncrackable cipher', which was a significant improvement 
on the previous substitution cipher.

The chapter also describes some of the other ciphers that were developed alongside 
the Vigenere cipher, and it includes a section on the development of the telegraph, 
a communication revolution that motivated the need for secure ciphers. 

Finally, the chapter explains how the Vigenere cipher was eventually cracked by 
Charles Babbage, the Victorian pioneer of computing.
