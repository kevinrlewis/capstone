We currently have effectively
unbreakable ciphers and systems that
solve the key distribution problem.
Nevertheless, cryptographers continue
to develop new systems, such as
quantum cryptography. It seems that
the search for better security will
continue forever. And the political
questions relating to cryptography
will carry on as well.
