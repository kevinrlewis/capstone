What would happen if cryptography
was banned? One option would be to
switch to steganography.
Cryptography hides the meaning of a
message, but steganography hides the
existence of a message. If the message
is hidden, then it is hard to block its
transmission.

Steganography is an ancient science. Invisible inks,
such as lemon juice, render the message invisible, but
gently heating lemon juice will develop the ink.
Microdots shrink the message to such a tiny size that
it can be pasted onto an innocuous letter and looks
like nothing more than a fullstop.

There has been a great deal of research into
developing steganographic techniques appropriate for
the Information Age. These are described in the next
section. As well as implementing secrecy,
steganography can be used as a digital watermark.
