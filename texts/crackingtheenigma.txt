When the Enigma cipher machine came into service in Germany in the 1920s, most 
other countries gave up hope of cracking it. The number of keys seemed too large 
check and the ever-changing mode or encryption seemed too complex to unpick.

However, one nation believed that the Enigma was crackable. Polish cryptanalysts 
made the first breakthrough, well before the outbreak of the Second World War.

Poland passed its work onto the British Government, who continued to crack 
Enigma throughout much of the war. The codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park 
used mathematics, engineering and intuition to crack Enigma, providing Churchill 
with an unparalleled insight into Hitler's military plans.
