Having heard about the ideas of asymmetric ciphers and the associated public and
private keys, mathematicians and cryptographers around the world tried to find the
appropriate mathematical function, but all attempts ended in failure until 1977,
when a trio of mathematicians at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology took
up the challenge.

They may not have realised it, but Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman would
invent the most important cipher of the twentieth century. The cipher, known by
their initials RSA, is explained in the following sections.
