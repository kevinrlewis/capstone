8. We lmow that exponentials in modular aritlunetic are one way functions, so it is very difficult to work backwards
from C = 11 and recover the original message, M. Hence, Eve cannot decipher the message.
9. However, Alice can decipher the message, because she has some special information: she lmows the values of p
and q. She calculates a special number, d, the decryption key, otherwise lmown as her private-key. The number d is
calculated according to the following formula

e x d = 1 (mod (p-1)x (q-1))
7x d= 1 (mod 16x 10)
7x d= 1 (mod 160)
d = 23
(The technique for quickly working out d is explained in the nefl section.)

10. To decrypt the message, Alice simply uses the following formula,

Message = C^d(mod 187)

Message = 11^23(mod 187)

Message = 11^1 x 11^2 x 11^4 x 11^16 (mod 187)

Message = 11x 121x 55 x 154 (mod 187)

Message = 88 = X in ASCII.

Having described RSA in terms of letter by letter                          Rivest, Shamir and Adleman had created a special
encryption, you might have spotted that this is nothing                 one-way function. It can be personalised by choosing p
more than monoalphabetic substitution and therefore                   and q, and publicly announcing N. Anybody can encrypt
easy to crack. In practice, encryption would occur with                 with the function, but only the person who created it
large blocks of bits, thereby making frequency analysis               (and who knows p and q) can decrypt with it.
impractical.
