The Vigenere cipher is one of the truly great breakthroughs in the development of 
cryptography. This section explains how the cipher works and why it is so strong 
compared to all other ciphers that preceded it. The birth of the cipher can be traced 
back to the work of the Italian genius Leon Alberti.

Born in 1404, Alberti was one of the leading figures of the Renaissance; a painter, 
composer, poet and philosopher. He was also the author of the first scientific analysis 
of perspective, a treatise on the housefly, and a funeral oration for his dog. He is 
probably best known as an architect, having designed Rome's first Trevi Fountain and 
having written "De Re Aedificatoria", the first printed book on architecture, which 
acted as a catalyst for the transition from Gothic to Renaissance design.

he had hit upon the most significant breakthough in encryption for over one 
thousand years, he failed to develop his concept into a fully formed system of 
encryption. That task fell to a diverse group of intellectuals, who built on Alberti's 
initial idea. First, there was Johannes Trithemius, a German abbot born in 1562, then 
Giovanni Porta, an Italian scientist born in 1535, and finally Blaise de Vigenere, a 
French diplomat born in 1523.

Vigenere became acquainted with the writings of Alberti, Trithemius and Porta, 
when, at the age of 26, he was sent to Rome on a two-year diplomatic mission. 
Initially, his interest in cryptography was purely practical and was linked his 
diplomatic work. Then, at the age of 39, Vigenere decided that he had accumulated 
enough money to be able to abandon his career and concentrate on a life of study. 
It was only then that he examined in detail the ideas of Alberti, Trithemius and 
Porta, weaving them into a coherent and powerful new cipher.
