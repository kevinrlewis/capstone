Postwar cryptography has been dominated by the computer. The
electromechanical Enigma machine was replaced by microprocessors, which are
capable of increasingly complex levels of encryption.

However, as you will see in the first section of this chapter, computer encryption is
not fundamentally different from pencil and paper encryption.

The later sections describe the most important development in cryptography for a
century or more, which has nothing to do with technology. These sections describe
the key distribution problem, how it was publicly solved, how it was secretly
solved, and how it has transformed security in the Information Age.
