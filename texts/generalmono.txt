Ciphers which employ a cipher alphabet which is simply a rearrangement of the plaintext alphabet, so that each 
letter of the plaintext is always replaced by the same letter are called monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.

If we permit the cipher alphabet to be any rearrangement of the plain alphabet, then we can generate an enormous 
number of distinct mode of encryption. There are over 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 such 
rearrangements, which gives rise to an equivalent number of distinct cipher alphabets. Each cipher alphabet is 
known as a key. If our message is intercepted by the enemy and the enemy correctly assumes that we have used a 
monoalphabetic substitution cipher, then there is still the horrendous challenge of checking all possible keys. if an 
enemy agent could check one of the possible keys every second, it would take roughly a billion times the lifetime 
of the universe to check all of them and find the correct one. This simple brute force approach clearly will not work.
