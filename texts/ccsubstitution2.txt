The resulting encrypted message is a single string of 35 binary digits, which can be transmitted to
the receiver, who uses the same key to reverse the substitution, thus recreating the original string of
binary digits. Finally, the receiver reinterprets the binary digits via ASCII, to regenerate the message
HELLO.
