The homophonic substitution cipher involves replacing each letter with a variety of substitutes, the number of 
potential substitutes being proportional to the frequency of the letter. For example, the letter 'a' account for roughly 
8% of all letters in English, so we assign 8 symbols to represent it. Each time 'a' appears in the plaintext it is 
roughly 1% of the ciphertext. The letter 'b' accounts for 2% of all letters and so we assign 2 symbols to represent it. 
Each time 'b' appears in the plaintext either of the two symbols can be chosen, so each symbol will also constitute 
it has only one substitute. In the example below, the substitutes happen to be 2-digit numbers and there are between 
1 and 12 substitutes for each letter depending on the letter's relative abundance.

The point of offering several substitution options for popular letters is to balance out the frequencies of symbols in 
the ciphertext. Every symbol will constitute roughly 1% of the ciphertext. If no symbol appears more frequently than 
any other, then this would appear to defy any potential attack via straightforward frequency analysis.
