Imagine that we want to encrypt the message, HELLO, and we want to employ a simple computer
version of a substitution cipher. We begin by converting the message into ASCII prior to
encryption, as shown below. As usual, substitution relies on a key that has been agreed between the
sender and receiver. In this case the key is the word DAVID translated into ASCII, and it is used in
the following way.

Each element of the plaintext is â€˜added' to the corresponding element of the key. Adding binary
digits can be thought of in terms of two simple rules. First, if the elements in the plaintext and key
are the same, then the element in the plaintext is substituted for zero in the ciphertext. Alternatively,
if the elements in the message and key are different, then the element in the plaintext is substituted
for one in the ciphertext. This form of 'addition' is technically known as 'addition modulo 2' or
exclusive OR'.
