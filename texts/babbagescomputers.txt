The turning point in Babbage's scientific career occurred in 1821, when he and the astronomer John 
Herschel were examining a set of mathematical tables, the sort used as the basis for astronomical, 
engineering and navigational calculations. The two men were disgusted by the number of errors in 
the tables, which in turn would generate flaws in important calculations. Indeed, many shipwrecks 
and engineering disasters were blamed on faulty tables.

These tables were calculated by hand, and the mistakes were simply the result of human error. This 
caused Babbage to exclaim: "I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam!" This 
inspired Babbage to build a machine capable of calculating accurate tables. In 1823 he started 
building 'Difference Engine No.1', consisting of 25,000 precision parts, funded by the government.

Although Babbage was a brilliant innovator, he was not a great implementer. After ten years of toil, 
he abandoned 'Difference Engine No.1,' and set to work on a new design called 'Difference Engine 
No.2'. Unfortunately, the goverment lost confidence in him and withdrew from the project - they 
had already spent 17,470 pounds, enough money to build a pair of battleships.
