The second stage of encryption, transposition, depends 
on a keyword, which in this case happens to he the word 
MARK, but you can choose your own keyword. The keyword 
must be shared with the receiver. Transposition is 
carried out as follows. First the letters of the keyword 
are written in the top row of a fresh grid. Next, the 
stage 1 ciphertext is written underneath it in a series of 
rows. Click the button labeled 'Complete Grid' to fill 
in this grid. The columns of the grid are then 
re-arranged so that the letters of the keyword are in 
alphabetical order. Click the button labelled 'Transpose 
Columns' to perform this transposition. The final 
ciphertext is achieved by going down each column and then 
writing out the letters in this new order. Click the 
'Final Stage' button to complete the encryption.
