Although the achievements of Bletchley Park were a team effort, 
Alan Turing stands out as probably the greatest British 
codebreaker of the Second World War.

Before the outbreak of the war, he was a mathematician at 
Cambridge University, where he laid the foundations for the 
theory of computers, many years before a programmable machine 
could be built. After joining Bletchley Park, he turned his brilliant 
mind to the problem of cracking codes. Turing's most important 
idea was the 'bombe', a mechanised way of cracking Enigma 
based on exploiting cribs. What follows is a greatly oversimplified 
explanation of Turing's brilliant idea.

Imagine that we are dealing with a 6-letter Enigma and that we 
have intercepted the Enigma enciphered message below. We 
suspect that the message really says BADCAFE. This puts a severe 
constraint on the key, because the key must turn BADCAFE into 
CFAABDD, and most Enigma settings will not do this.
