As well as adding, you could multiply. 
Or you could multiply and add. This is 
known as an affine cipher.

The next page contains an affine 
encryption tool. You need to be slightly 
careful when using it, as it has hidden 
subtleties.

For example, you cannot multiply by 
any number. The numbers must not 
have a common factor with 26. So you 
can multiply by 3, but not 8. (8 and 26 
can both be divided by 2!)

Also, what happens if you have a 
number that is bigger than 25? You 
need to employ so-called modular 
arithmetic. The cipher tool does all this 
for you, but if you want to know more about 
modular arithmetic, then there is 
a link on the next page.
