Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Britain moved its codebreaking centre to a large 
Victorian Tudor-Gothic mansion house called Bletchley Park, situated north of London, halfway 
between Cambridge and Oxford, where it would recruit most of its cryptanalysts.

The personnel consisted of mathematicians, scientists, engineers, linguists, classicists, 
curators, bridge players, chess players and anybody else who had the sort of mind suited to solving 
puzzles. Cracking codes was very much a team effort â€” codebreakers worked together in huts, each but 
dedicated to breaking into a specific Enigma network. Gordon Welclunan, who was in charge of 
Hut 6, described his team as 'a pack of hounds trying to pick up the scent.'

In addition to the cryptographers, there developed a huge staff of transcribers, interceptors, 
translators and machine operators. By the end of the war, Bletchley Park had grown from a few 
codebreakers working in a couple of offices and huts into an industrial complex.
