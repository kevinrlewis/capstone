Asymmetric-key, or public-key, algorithms use pairs of keys. Public keys which can vary 
drastically, and private keys which only the owner knows. This allows authentication to 
happen where the public key is used to verify that a holder of the paired private key 
sent the message. It also allows encryption to happen, where the holder of the private 
key is the only one able to decrypt the message when encrypted by the public key. Some 
example algorithms/protocols include: RSA, SSH, Bitcoin, Secure Socket Layer, and 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
