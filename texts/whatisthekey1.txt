As explained in an earlier section, an encryption system can be split into the general algorithm, and
the specific key, the key being a flexible component of the algorithm. Usually the enemy knows the
algorithm, but do not know which key is being used for a particular message. (CLICK HERE if you
want to revisit the section about keys.)

The Enigma cipher also operates according to this principle. The Enigma machine is the algorithm,
but the machine can be set up in many different ways, and the exact way that it is set up is the key.
Both the sender and the receiver must know the key in order to encrypt and decrypt, but the key is
kept secret from any potential eavesdropper. So, even if the British had captured an Enigma
machine, then they still did not know the key used to encrypt a message. In theory, German
communications were secure, as long as the keys were secure.
