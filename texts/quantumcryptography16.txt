Turbulence causes another headache too.
Changes in refractive index cause the beam to
wander so that it misses the satellite's antenna.
To keep the photon beam on course, Alice
monitors the feeble reflections from the timing
pulses, and uses the information to steer the
photon beam.

Earlier this year, Hughes set a new record for
quantum cryptography through air when he
exchanged a key across 500 metres. Bob, the
receiver, was equipped with a 3.5-inch-diameter
telescope. Each incoming photon encountered a
beam splitter, which randomly reflected or
transmitted the photon, steering it towards one
type of filter or the other.
