In 1885, a pamphlet was published. It spoke of a cowboy, buried treasure, 
and a mysterious set of messages encrypted using a book cipher.

The pamphlet tells the story of Thomas J. Beale, who 
apparently discovered a rich seam of gold near Sante Fe, and 
who brought it back to Virginia to bury it. He headed back 
West to find more gold, then disappeared without trace. The 
details of the treasure were concealed within three encrypted 
notes, describing its contents, its location, and names of 
relatives who should inherit it upon Beale's death.

The second Beale note was decrypted when the keytext was 
identified as the Declaration of Independence. For example, 
the first number in the note is 115, which represents 'i', 
because the 115th word of the Declaration is 'instituted'. The 
note revealed the contents of the treasure, today valued at 
$20 million. As yet, nobody has discovered the keytext for 
the first and third notes, and the treasure remains hidden.

The three encrypted notes and the decipherment of the 
second one can be seen by clicking on the buttons below. 
By all means attempt to crack the undeciphered notes, but 
be warned that hundered of experts have tried and failed, so 
do not devote too much time towards what is likely to be a 
fruitless pursuit. In particular, you should be aware that 
some folk believe that the whole Beale story is a hoax.
