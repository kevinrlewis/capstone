At the start of the twenty-first century, we have
virtually unbreakable methods of encryption. We
live in a golden age of cryptography. So has
cryptographic development come to an end?

Politics continue to influence the science of secrecy.
Threats to restrict the use of cryptography have
accelerated the development of an alternative
technology known as steganography. At the same
time, cryptography is also moving in new
directions. Perhaps the ultimate encryption system
is quantum cryptography, a technology that relies
on the exchange of individual photons of light.

This final chapter also looks at the implications of
the widespread use of strong cryptography. Is this
necessarily a good thing? Honest citizens can use
cryptography for privacy, but criminals can use it
to avoid surveillance.
