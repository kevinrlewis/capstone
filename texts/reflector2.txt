In the Enigma machine above, you can encrypt
the word FACE (or a word of your choice).

Having created the ciphertext, you can reset the
scramblers (the rotors), and then decipher the
ciphertext.

In short, choose a setting and type in the
plaintext to get the ciphertext. Then return to
the original setting, and when you type in the
ciphertext you get the plaintext.
