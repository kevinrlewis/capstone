So far, the term cryptography has been used to describe methods for protecting messages from
being read by eavesdroppers. However, cryptography has a much broader meaning in the
Information Age. Cryptography, largely due to techniques related to public keys, can help establish
trust in the virtual world in a number of different ways. Crypto can be split into four branches.

Secrecy

Secrecy has long been the mainstay of 
cryptography and continues to be crucial for 
many users. Usually the user wants a cipher that 
is as secure as possible, but sometimes ease of 
use, speed of encryption and computational 
limits might be more important criteria than 
absolute security.

Integrity

The contents of a message may not be secret, 
but the sender might want to be sure that the 
contents have not been tampered with in transit. 
A 1-way function can guarantee this.
