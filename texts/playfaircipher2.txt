- If both letters are in the same row, then they are replaced by the letter to the 
  immediate right of each one; 'mi' becomes 'nk'. If a letter is at the end of a row, it is 
  replaced by the letter at the beginning; 'ni' becomes 'gk'.
- If both letters are in the same column, then they are replaced by the letter immediately 
  beneath each one; 'ge' becomes 'og'. If a letter is at the bottom of a column, it is 
  replaced by the letter at the top; 've' becomes 'cg'.
- If the digraph letters are neither in the same row nor the same column, the rule differs. 
  To encipher the first letter, look along its row until you reach the column containing the 
  second letter; the letter at this intersection replaces the first letter. To encipher the 
  second letter, look along its row until you reach the column containing the first letter;
  the letter at this intersection replaces the second letter. Hence, 'me' becomes 'gd'.
