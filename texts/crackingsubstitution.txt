The monoalphabetic substitution cipher seemed uncrackable, because of the huge 
number of possible keys. There was, however, a shortcut that would undermine 
its security. This section tells the story of how this codebreaking technique was 
invented, explains how it works and provides you with a tool that will help you 
to crack ciphers.

The cracking of the substitution cipher marks the birth of cryptanalysis 
(codebreaking). This occurred during the Golden Age of the Islamic civilisation, 
when many ancient foreign manuscripts were being brought to Baghdad to be 
added to the great Arab libraries. Some of these manuscipts were encrypted, 
which motivated the codebreakers to crack the ciphers and reveal the secrets 
within.
