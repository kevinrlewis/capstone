Although it seemed like an impossible problem, the
crypto-trio were willing to try. As Hellman explains,
to attempt this sort of problem requires an element
of foolishness: "The way to get to the top of the
heap in terms of developing original research is be a
fool, because only fools keep trying. You have idea
number 1, you get excited, and it flops. Then you
have idea number 2, you get excited, and it flops
Then you have idea number 99, you get excited, and
it flops. Only a fool would be excited by the 100th
idea, but it might take 100 ideas before one really
pays off. Unless you're foolish enough to be
continually excited, you won't have the motivation,
you won't have the energy to carry it through. God
rewards fools."

The "Apparent Solution" button shows that their
ultimate goal was at least possible in theory.
