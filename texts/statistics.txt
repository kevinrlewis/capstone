Statistics is an area of mathematics that attempts to say something about a large population by 
examining a small sample of the entire population. For example, if an alien landed in the middle of 
London and analysed the first 100 people it encounted, then roughly 50 would be men and 50 
would be women. The alien could generalise and come to the conclusion that half of the human 
species is male and half is female.

But such generalising will fail if the sample is too small. If the alien analysed just the first two 
people it met, then they might both be women and it would wrongly assume that the entire human 
population is female.

This is relevant to codebreaking by frequency analysis, because a short plaintext will not necessarily 
match the average set of frequencies for letters, because it contains only a small sample of letters. 
You can see this by clicking on the 3 buttons below and comparing the frequency distribution of a 
single word, a single line and a whole verse from a nursery rhyme, which you can compare to the 
average frequency distribution.
