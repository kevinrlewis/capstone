The traditional forms of substitution ciphers, those that existed prior to the 
Vigenere cipher, were called monoalphabetic, because they used only one cipher 
alphabet per message. In contrast, the Vigenere cipher is known as 
polyalphabetic, because it employs several cipher alphabets per message. The 
polyalphabetic nature of the Vigenere cipher is what imbues it with its strength, 
but it also makes it more complicated to use. The effort required to implement 
the Vigenere cipher discouraged people from employing it. 

For many 17th century purposes, the monoalphabetic substitution cipher was 
perfectly adequate. If you wanted to ensure that your servant was unable to read 
your private correspondence, then the old-fashioned type of cipher was ideal. 
Monoalphabetic substitution was quick, easy and secure against people 
unschooled in cryptanalysis. In fact, the simple monoalphabetic substitution 
cipher endured in various forms for many centuries. 

However, the simple monoalphabetic cipher was clearly inadequate for serious 
military and government communications where security was paramount, yet 
serious cryptographers were still reluctant to adopt the polyalphabetic cipher 
because of its complexity. Military communications, in particular, required speed 
and simplicity, and a diplomatic office might be sending and receiving hundreds 
of messages each day, so time was of the essence.

Consequently, cryptographers searched for an intermediate cipher, one that was 
harder to crack than a simple monoalphabetic cipher, but one that was simpler to 
implement than a polyalphabetic cipher. There were various candidates that 
could act as the intermediate cipher, which are explored in this section.
