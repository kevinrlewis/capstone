Unknown to Babington and Mary, their courier Gilbert Gifford was a double-agent. He showed 
their letters to Elizabeth's spymaster, Francis Walsingham, before delivering them. In turn, 
Walsingham made copies and gave them to his chief codebreaker Thomas Phelippes.

Phelippes was a master of frequency analysis, and it was merely a matter of time before he cracked 
Babington's cipher. When Phelippes deciphered Babington's message, clearly proposing an 
assassination of Elizabeth, he immediately dispatched the damning text to his master.
