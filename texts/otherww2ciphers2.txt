While British codebreakers were breaking the German ciphers and influencing the course of the war in Europe,
American codebreakers were having an equally important influence on events in the Pacific arena by cracking
Japanese ciphers such as Purple. For example, in June 1942, the Americans deciphered a message which enabled
them to foil Japan's attempt to capture Midway Island in one of the most important battles of World War Two.

The true strength and potential of machine ciphers was demonstrated by the [ref=lorenz][color=ffff66]Typex cipher machine[/color][/ref], used by the
British Army and Air Force, and the SIGABA cipher machine, used by the American military. Both of these cipher
machines were more complex than the Enigma machine and both were used properly, and therefore they remained
unbroken throughout the war. Allied cryptographers were confident that complicated electromechanical machine
ciphers could guarantee secure communication. However complicated machine ciphers were not the only way of
sending secure messages during the Second World War. Indeed, one of the most secure methods of encryption was
also one of the simplest - the use of Native American speakers of the Navajo language as radio operators.
