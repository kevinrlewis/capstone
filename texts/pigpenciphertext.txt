The Pig Pen Cipher was used by Freemasons in the 18th Century to keep their records private. The cipher does not 
substitute one letter for another, rather it substitutes each letter for a symbol. The alphabet is written in the grids 
shown, and then each letter is enciphered by replacing it with a symbol that corresponds to the portion of the pigpen 
grid that contains the letter.
