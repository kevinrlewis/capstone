So far, the only known way to crack RSA is to factor N, the public key. This would give you 
p and q, the private key required for decryption. The bigger the value of N, the harder it is to factor.
Typically, for secure communication, one might use a value of N equal to 1024 bits (or over 300
decimal digits) or even 2048 bits.
