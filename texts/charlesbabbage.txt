Although Charles Babbage is best known for developing the blueprint for the 
modern computer, his interests were many and varied. He pursued the life of a 
roving scholar, applying his mind to whatever problem tickled his fancy. His 
inventions include the speedometer and the 'cow-catcher'.

He even set his mind towards reforming the postal system. It used to be the case 
that the cost of sending a letter depended on the distance that the letter was to 
travel, but Babbage pointed out that the cost of labour required to calculate the 
price for each individual letter was more than the cost of the postage. Instead 
he proposed the system we still use today, a single price for all letters regardless 
of where they are going. 

He was also interested in politics and social issues, and towards the end of his life he began a 
campaign to get rid of the street musicians who roamed London. He complained that the music 
"not infrequently gives rise to a dance by little ragged urchins, and sometimes half-intoxicated men, 
who occasionally accompany the noise with their own discordant voices... Another class who are 
great supporters of street music consists of ladies of 
elastic virtue and cosmopolitan tendencies, to whom 
it affords a decent excuse for displaying their 
fascinations at their open windows." Unfortunately 
for Babbage, the musicians fought back by gathering 
in large groups around his house and playing as loud 
as possible.
