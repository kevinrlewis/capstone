In its most basic form, the Enigma 
machine consists of a keyboard 
connected to a lampboard by electric 
wires. In between is a solid disk 
containing wiring that confuses the 
connections between the keyboard and 
the lampboard, e.g. typing A does not 
necessarily illuminate the lamp A.





So far, this central rotor disk merely 
provides a simple monoalphabetic 
substitution cipher and can be cracked 
by frequency analysis. B is enciphered 
as C ... and will always be enciphered
as C.
