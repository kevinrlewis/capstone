Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment network that operates using an asymmetric cryptographic 
protocol. Users send and receive bitcoins, which are units of currency, by broadcasting 
digitally signed messages to the network using bitcoin wallet software. Bitcoin uses 
blocks that are hashed twice using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Transactions are recorded 
into a distribted, replicated public databse known as the blockchain, with consensus 
achieved by a proof-of-work system called "mining". The Bitcoin protocol was designed in 
2008 and released in 2009 as open source software.
