To make Diffie's idea work in the virtual world of computer networks, it was necessary to transfer 
the idea from a metal padlock and iron box to a mathematical padlock and a virtual box. 

The mathematical padlock had to behave just like a real padlock. A real padlock is easy to lock but 
very hard to unlock. This is similar to a mathematical one-way function, which is easy to perform in 
one direction but hard to reverse. However, a padlock is special, because it can be unlocked with a 
key, so cryptographers had to find a mathematical one-way function which could be reversed with a 
piece of special information (the private-key). The crypto-gurus who eventually discovered the 
mathematical padlock were Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman.
