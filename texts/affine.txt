So far, cryptography does not look very 
mathematical. It seems to be about 
letters rather than numbers. In fact, 
cryptography is riddled with 
mathematics.

For example, the Caesar cipher is about 
addition. When every letter is shifted by 
one place, this is effectively adding 1. 
You can think of converting every letter 
(A-Z) to a number (0-25), then you add 1,
and then convert the number back into a 
letter. If A is 0, then (0+1=1), and 1 is 
equivalent to B - so A has been 
encrypted as B. Decipherment is a matter 
of subtraction.

This might seem unnecessarily 
complicated, but mathematics is the best 
way to think of cryptography, especially 
as the encryption algorithms get more 
complex.
