In the early 1970s, Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle teamed up at
Stanford University, California, to crack the key distribution problem. Their
motivation was to give privacy to everyone.

To have private communication you need to encrypt, to encrypt you need to
distribute keys, and the only people who had the money to do this were
governments, the military, banks and big business. The ordinary citizen had no hope
of private communication unless the key distribution problem could be solved.
