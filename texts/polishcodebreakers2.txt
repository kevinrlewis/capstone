The foremost Polish cryptographer was Marian Rejewski. He invented a way of breaking Enigma 
based on the message key setting. Before sending a message, a German operator would encode a 
new setting twice, and then encode the actual message according to this new message key setting. 
Encoding and sending the setting twice was supposed to reduce the risk of communication errors.
