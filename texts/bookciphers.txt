The key in a bok cipher is a piece of text, often from a book. Each letter of the keytext (or perhaps 
just the inital letter of each word) is sequentially numbered. Then, to encrypt a letter in the 
message, you need to find the same letter in the keytext and identify its associated number. Each 
letter is then substituted with a number. Imagine that the previous sentence is the keytext, then the 
word 'cheers' could be encrypted as 3, 4, 1, 9, 10, 12. Crucially, the two E's in the message have been 
encrypted in two different ways, as 1 and 9.

The advantage of this system is that each plain letter can be encrypted in many different ways. The 
letter E may appear thousands of times in the keytext, so there are thousands of numbers that could 
be used to replace the appearance of E in the message. Usually, the only hope of cracking a book 
cipher is to identify the keytext.

In the following tool, start by typing in your message. Then choose a keytext from 
the ten that are available. To ensure that every keytext has every required letter, the 
entire alphabet is added at the end of each one. Finally click on 'Encipher' to 
complete the encryption process.
