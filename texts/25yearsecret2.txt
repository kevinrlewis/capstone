This story reminds us that much cryptographic
research continues to go on behind closed
doors, and we will only know what GCHQ or
the NSA is capable of when they decide to tell
us. Although much research is conducted in the
more open worlds of academia and business,
government research laboratories are spending a
fortune on codes and codebreaking.

Ellis, Cocks and Williamson follow in the
tradition of Charles Babbage and the
cryptographers at Bletchley Park. The heroes of
cryptography often remain anonymous.
