The initial breakthrough was made in 1969 by
James Ellis, who worked in a section of
GCHQ known as the Communications
Electronics Security Group (CESG). He made
the same leap that Whit Diffie would make,
i.e., he conceived of the asymmetric cipher.
His formulation was different and he called it
non-secret encryption, but nevertheless Ellis
had discovered public-key cryptography.
