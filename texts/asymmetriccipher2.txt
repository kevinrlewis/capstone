In theory, Alice would create her encryption and 
decryption keys. Alice keeps the decryption key secret,
so it is called Alice's private-key. However, she
publishes the encryption key so that everybody has
access to it, which is why it is called Alice's public-key.
If Bob wants to send Alice a message, he simply looks
up her public-key, which would be listed in something
akin to a telephone directory, and uses it to encrypt
the message. Perversely, Bob (the sender) is encrypting
a message using Alice's (the receiver's) public-key.
When it arrives, Alice can decrypt it using her private
decryption key.
