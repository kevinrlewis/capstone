The ideal solution would be to find a way to
send quantum keys up through the air to
waiting satellites. The Quantum Information
Team at Los Alamos, led by Ricth Hughes, is
the world leader in such 'free-space quantum
cryptography'. For the past two years, the group
has been steadily overcoming the technical
difficulties and extending the transmission
distances step by step.

Ultimately, they want to be able to fire
individual photons to hit a satellite's receiver,
which is only a few centimetres across and orbits
at an altitude of 300 kilometres. The photons
must pass through the atmosphere without
being absorbed-so that the signal is not simply
lost-and they must not change their
polarisation.

It's easy enough to make sure that the photons
are not absorbed. You just have to choose a
wavelength that the molecules in the atmosphere
ignore. Hughes's team has opted for 770
nanometres. Longer wavelengths also pass
through the air unscathed, but are more
susceptible to turbulence, which changes the
local refractive index of the air and thus twists
the orientation of the photon's polarisation.
