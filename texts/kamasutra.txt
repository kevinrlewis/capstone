One of the earliest desciptions of encryption by substitution appears in the 
Kama-sutra, a text written in the 4th century AD by the Brahmin scholar 
Vatsyayana, but based on manuscripts dating back to the 4th century BC. The 
Kama-sutra recommends that women should study 64 arts, including cooking, 
dressing, massage and the preparation of perfumes. The list also includes some less 
obvious arts, including conjuring, chess, bookbinding and carpentry. Number 45 on 
the list is mlecchita-vikalpa, the art of secret writing, advocated in order to help 
women conceal the details of their liaisons. One of the recommended techniques 
involves randomly pairing letters of the alphabet, and then substituting each letter in 
the original message with its partner.
