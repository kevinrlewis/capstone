Sometime in the 1460s, Alberti was wandering through the gardens of the Vatican, when he bumped 
into his friend Leonardo Dato, the pontifical secretary, who began chatting to him about some of 
the finer points of cryptography. This casual conversation prompted ALberti to write an essay on the 
subject, outlining what he believed to be a new form of cipher. Up until this point, a substitution 
cipher involved establishing a single cipher alphabet for encrypting each message. However, Alberti 
proposed using two or more cipher alphabets, switching between them during encipherment, thereby 
confusing potential cryptanalysts.

Here we have two possible cipher alphabets, and we can encrypt a message by alternating between 
them. The first letter of the plaintext message is encrypted using Ciphertext Alphabet 1, the second 
letter of the message is encrypted using Ciphertext Alphabet 2. We encrypt the third letter of the 
message by returning to Ciphertext Alphabet 1, the fourth letter is encrypted using Ciphertext 
Alphabet 2, and so on. To try out this cipher, type your message into the box labeled Plaintext, 
then click the 'Encipher Text' button.
