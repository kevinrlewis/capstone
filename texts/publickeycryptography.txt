Eventually, the team of Diffie,
Hellman and Merkle discovered a
solution to the key distribution
problem, one that offered real hope.
Whit Diffie conceived the notion of
an asymmetric cipher, which is
explained at the start of this section.
The idea was perfect, but turning
theory into a practical encryption
algorithm proved to be problematic.
The breakthrough was eventually
made by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir
and Len Adleman (RSA), and their
story is told in this section.

Also in this section, you will find
buttons that explain how the RSA
algorithm works and how it was
independently discovered in secret by
British cryptographers working at
Government Communications
Headquarters.
