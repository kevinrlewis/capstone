The Enigma machine was flawed, partly
because it was pioneering technology.
For example, the Enigma machine
cannot encrypt a letter as itself, which
helped codebreakers find and position
cribs, as explained earlier in this section.
When other countries later built their
own versions of mechanical enciphering
machines, they were careful not to mimic
the mistakes of the Enigma design.
There was a flaw in the way the machine
was used. Operators would send
stereotypical and predictable messages,
which would also help codebreakers find
cribs.

There were instructions that an Enigma
rotor could not remain in the same place
two days running and that plug cables
could not swap neighbouring letters. This
was supposed to help randomise the key,
but it merely reduced the key space.
