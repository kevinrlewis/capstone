The loop containing 3 pairs of letters leads us to the following scenario. Take three Enigma machines that will 
correspond to the three pairings. The first is set to some basic setting, the second is set so that its rotor is three 
places further on (because it represents the letter pairing three places further on), and the third is set so that its rotor 
is four places further on (because it represents the letter pairing four places further on). The three Enigmas can then 
be directly wired to each other, because the loop tells us that the output of the first is the same as the input of the 
second and so on. Bletchley constructed larger blocks of Enigmas (known as bombes) that could he wired in this way.

In the vastly simplified diagram above, there is no plugboard to be seen, because Turing realised that we can ignore 
the plugboard and the massive key space that it would otherwise contribute to the problem. The plugboard can he 
ignored because at the output of the first Enigma it might swap A with P, but at the input of the next Enigma it would 
swap P hack with A â€” the plugboards effectively cancel each other out.

With this set up, Turing's bombe could check for consistency. Was there a loop in the bombe that reflected the 
original loop in the crib? Once each of the six inputs are tested, every Enigma moves forward one rotor position, 
keeping in step, and the six inputs are tested again. This process is repeated until a complete circuit is found. You can 
see this by clicking the button at the top of the page and running the bombe demo.
