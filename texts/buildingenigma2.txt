This section explains how the 
Enigma works, starting with a 
general overview and then 
describing its components one by 
one. Later sections explain how 
the Enigma was used and how it 
was broken.

The Enigma cipher machine was 
invented by the Gennan engineer 
Arthur Scherbius, who patented it 
in 1918.

Others came up with similw 
concepts at wound the same time 
in other parts of the world, but 
German security failures in World 
War One meant that Scherbius 
received the support needed to 
mass produce his machine.
