The early twentieth century began without a secure encryption system, yet the need for one 
was greater than ever. The development of radio communication by Guglielmo Marconi gave 
rise to a new communications revolution, but radio waves could be easily intercepted. Then 
the outbreak of the First World War further increased the need for a new strong cipher.

This chapter describes some of the encryption systems used between 1914 and 1918. 
However, security blunders proved that there was a need for a radically new cipher. 
Between the wars, German engineers invented the Enigma cipher machine, one of the most 
notorious ciphers in history. Initially it seemed that the Enigma machine ushered in a 
new era of security that would help the Nazis win victory, b. a team of brilliant 
codebreakers based at Bletchley Park discovered weaknesses in the cipher and changed the 
course of the war. The following sections describe the Enigma machine, how it was used, 
how it was broken and its influence on World War Two.
