In WWII, Enigma keys would be delivered by
couriers to Enigma operators across rivers and
deserts. After the war, countries would send secure
escorts to accompany keys being delivered to far off
embassies. For centuries, it was assumed that there
was no solution to the key distribution problem apart
from delivering the keys by hand. The rest of this
chapter reveals how cryptographers realised that key
distribution was not a problem, because key
distribution could be avoided!
