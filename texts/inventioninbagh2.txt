Although it is not known who first realised that the 
variation in the frequencies of letters could be 
exploited in order to break ciphers, the earliest 
known descsription of the technique is by the 9th 
century scientist Abu Yusuf Ya'qub ibn Is-haq ibn 
as-Sabbah ibn 'omran ibn Ismail al-Kindi. Known 
as 'the philosopher of the Arabs', al-Kindi was the 
author of 290 books about medicine, astronomy, 
mathematics, linguistics and music, but his greatest 
treatise, which was only rediscovered in 1987 in the 
Sulaimaniyya Ottoman Archive in Istanbul, is 
entitled "A Manuscript on Deciphering 
Cryptographic Messages". To see a clip showing
