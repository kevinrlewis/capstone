This section of a monthly key sheet has 
a row showing the key setting for each 
particular day. Each mrning, operators 
would change their machines to the 
appropriate setting for that day.

In theory, it would have been possible to 
communicate all messages using this one 
setting for the rest of the day, but in 
general it is more secure to change the 
setting as often as possible. Hence, 
prior to sending a message, the sender 
would transmit (in code) a new random 
rotor setting for the rotors. The 
sender would then move the rotors to 
this new setting and encode the message 
using this revised key.
