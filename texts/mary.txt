In 1542, the Scottish army of King James V was demolished by the English forces of 
Henry VIII at the Battle of Solway Moss. Two weeks later his daughter Mary was born, 
and just one week after that James died, heartbroken by his military defeat, but 
safe in the knowledge that he had an heir.

This was the start of a tumultuous life for Mary. She was crowned Queen of Scotland 
aged just nine months, she fled to France in 1548 when English forces threatened to 
invade, she married the dauphin, was crowned Queen of France, but was then 
widowed and returned to Scotland in 1561. Two wretched marriages and revolt 
forced Mary to flee Scotland again, this time to England, ruled by her cousin Queen 
Elizabeth I. But, instead of protecting Mary, Elizabeth imprisoned her, because 
Elizabeth was Protestant, whereas Mary was Catholic, and Mary might inspire a 
revolt by English Catholics. Indeed, while in prison, Mary was involved in a plot to 
assassinate Elizabeth. The success of the plot relied entirely on an encrypted letter.
