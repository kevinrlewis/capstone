The man who discovered Babbage's role in 
cracking the Vigenere cipher was the Danish 
scholar Ole Franksen. He speculates that 
Babbage did not publish his breakthrough in 
the interests of national security. The 
Crimean W. had broken out and Babbage's 
teclunique would have given the British an 
advantage. Franksen talks about the 
breakthrough in the video clip.
