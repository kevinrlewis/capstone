In transposition ciphers, the letters of the message are simply, 
rearranged, effectively genereating an anagram.

In order for transposition to be effective, the rearrangement of letters 
needs to follow a straightforward system, one that has been previously 
agreed by the sender and receiver, but kept secret from the enemy. In 
this section we explore two types of transposition: the railfence cipher 
and the scytale cipher.

The 'rail fence' transposition involves writing the message such that 
alternate letters are written on separate upper and lower lines. The 
sequence of letters on the upper line is then followed by the sequence 
on the lower line, to create the final encrypted message. To see how the 
railfence cipher works click the top button on the right of this screen.
